##Example hosted [here](http://jmarq.github.io/towed)

##Data is coming from [city of chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ygr5-vcbg/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD)

there's a bash/curl script that downloads data, a python script that gets the color counts from the data and stores them in a separate file, 
and an index page that loads that file and processes with javascript.
